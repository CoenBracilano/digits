Digits is a Next.js 14 application that:

- Allows users to create an account
- Store and edit lists of contacts
- Add timestamped notes to each contact


## Installation

First, dowload a copy of [Digits](https://github.com/CoenBracilano/digits), note that digits is private so you will need to request permission to download the files.


Second, in your copy of Digits, [install PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Then create a database for your application.

```

$ createdb digits
Password:
$

```

Third, seed the database using `npx prisma db seed`.

```

$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options {"module":"CommonJS"} prisma/seed.ts` ...
Seeding the database
Creating user: admin@foo.com with role: ADMIN
Creating user: john@foo.com with role: USER

ðŸŒ± The seed command has been executed.

```

## Running the system
